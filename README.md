Welcome to the Algorithm Toolkit—a living repository built for clarity, precision, and reuse. This isn’t just a collection of code; it’s a strategic framework for mastering algorithmic problem-solving from first principles.

Curated by a backend engineer who treats every bug like a stealth mission and every edge case like a hidden blade, this toolkit reflects a disciplined approach to learning: dry runs, trace tables, and minimal abstractions that teach as much as they solve.

Here you'll find:

🔍 Clean implementations of classic algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)

🧪 Edge-case breakdowns and dry-run examples for deep internalization

🧰 Reusable mental models and decision trees for debugging and optimization

📜 Documentation that’s lean, intentional, and built to scale your thinking

Whether you're revising fundamentals or building your own stealth toolkit, this repo is designed to be your silent companion—efficient, reliable, and always ready for the next mission
